# RK Barbershop System

## 1. Overview
RK Barbershop is a full booking and shop management system.

It has two sides:
- Customer side: public website for booking and queue joining
- Admin side: dashboard for services, barbers, bookings, queue, and settings

The project uses React on the client, Firebase Firestore as database, Firebase Auth for admin login, and Node/Express plus Vercel serverless APIs for backend operations.

---

## 2. What Is Included

### 2.1 Customer Features
- View shop information, services, barbers, and location
- Book appointment in guided steps
- Choose booking type:
  - Reservation
  - Walk-in
- Choose barber
- Choose one or more services
- Enter personal details and notes
- Upload payment proof image for reservations with payable amount
- View and download official shop GCash QR directly inside booking modal (no redirect)
- View booking summary before submit

### 2.2 Pricing Features
- Price now comes from barber rates, based on customer choice:
  - Reservation uses barber reserve price
  - Walk-in uses barber walk-in price
- Step 2 (Choose Barber) shows the selected type price
- Review step shows the booking price and total
- Admin booking table and booking detail card show correct fallback price for older records

### 2.3 Service Features
- Services can be marked as no price
- If no price is enabled, price is hidden from customer-facing service lists
- Admin service edit now correctly detects old no-price records with zero amount

### 2.4 Booking Security and Confirmation Features
- Reservation bookings are created through backend API, not direct client write
- Server computes final booking price to prevent client tampering
- Reservation with payable amount requires uploaded payment proof on server-side validation
- Reservation sends customer action email with secure links:
  - Accept
  - Cancel
  - Reschedule
- Token in email is hashed in database for safety
- Admin cannot confirm reservation until customer accepted from email
- If customer does not act before one hour before appointment time, reservation is auto-cancelled
- Walk-in bookings do not require email confirmation

### 2.5 Customer Action Pages (Accept, Cancel, Reschedule)
- Booking action pages were redesigned with a look close to the homepage visual style
- Pages include:
  - branded layout
  - clearer result states
  - back to homepage button
- Reschedule link now opens a real reschedule form
- Customer can directly pick new date and time from the page
- Reschedule is validated against barber availability and days off
- After successful reschedule:
  - booking is updated immediately
  - booking is confirmed (no admin confirmation needed for this action)
  - customer receives a new email with updated schedule details

### 2.6 Admin Dashboard Features
- Dashboard overview stats
- Service management
- Barber management
- Booking management
- Queue management
- Shop settings management
- Payment settings include GCash number + QR image upload
- Uploaded QR is shown to customers in reservation flow
- Booking detail dialog with customer confirmation state
- Booking detail dialog includes payment proof preview/download
- Booking reschedule action is available in admin booking details and booking context menu

### 2.7 Real-Time Features
- Admin bookings list updates in real time using Firestore snapshots

## 4. How The System Works

### 4.1 High-Level Flow
1. Customer opens website and submits booking form
2. Frontend sends booking data to backend API endpoint
3. Backend validates input and loads barber record
4. Backend calculates booking price by booking type
5. Backend stores booking in Firestore
6. If reservation:
   - backend creates secure action token hash
   - backend sends email links (accept, cancel, reschedule)
7. Customer action updates booking state through secure action endpoint
  - accept -> confirmed
  - cancel -> cancelled
  - reschedule -> customer chooses new schedule, system validates availability, then confirms booking and sends updated email
8. Admin dashboard listens in real time and updates instantly
9. Auto-expire endpoint cancels unattended reservation when time window is passed

### 4.2 Reservation State Logic
- New reservation: pending + customerDecision awaiting
- Customer accept: booking status confirmed
- Customer cancel: booking status cancelled
- Customer reschedule: booking date/time updated and status confirmed without needing admin confirmation
- No customer action before cutoff: auto-cancelled with expired decision

### 4.3 Price Logic
- Reservation total = selected barber reserve price
- Walk-in total = selected barber walk-in price
- Service line prices can be hidden for no-price services

## 12. Vercel Deployment Guide
1. Push repository to GitHub
2. Import project in Vercel
3. Add all environment variables in Vercel Project Settings
4. Deploy

Function limit note:
- Vercel Hobby allows up to 12 Serverless Functions per deployment
- This repo is structured to stay within that limit by keeping shared helpers outside the `api` folder and combining upload routes into one function

Cron note:
- Vercel Hobby only supports daily cron
- Current schedule in vercel.json is daily
- For higher frequency on free tier, use external scheduler and call:
  - /api/cron/expire-bookings?secret=YOUR_CRON_SECRET

---

  - Customer booking action pages and result pages
  - For reschedule, GET serves form page and POST submits new schedule
- GET /api/cron/expire-bookings
  - Auto-cancel unattended reservations past action window

### 13.2 Upload Endpoints
- POST /api/uploads/image
  - Upload QR/proof image to free host provider
  - Provider order: ImgBB (primary) then fallback hosts
- GET /api/uploads/download?url=...&filename=...
  - Secure in-app file download proxy (host allowlist enforced)

### 13.3 Admin Endpoints

- Can manage bookings
- Cannot confirm reservation before customer acceptance
- Can reschedule booking directly from admin dashboard

---

## 15. Security Notes
- Price is computed on server, not trusted from client
- Customer action token is hashed in database
- Admin routes require Firebase token and admin authorization
- Optional CRON_SECRET secures cron endpoint
- Keep all credentials in env variables, never in source code

---

## 16. Troubleshooting

### 16.1 POST /api/bookings returns 404 API route not found
Cause:
- Running stale server process
Fix:
- Restart development server

### 16.2 Booking email not sent
Check:
- SMTP_HOST, SMTP_PORT, SMTP_USER, SMTP_PASS
- BOOKING_FROM_EMAIL is verified in Brevo
- Brevo sender/domain verification status

### 16.3 Image upload failed
Check:
- IMGBB_API_KEY exists in local .env and deployment environment
- Development server was restarted after env changes
- Fallback provider/network access is available

### 16.4 Admin booking list not updating live
Check:
- Firestore rules and connectivity
- User is on updated build with snapshot-based bookings hooks

### 16.5 Customer reschedule failed
Check:
- Selected date is inside barber available days
- Selected date is not listed in barber days off
- Selected time is inside barber schedule window
- Action link is used before one-hour cutoff

### 16.6 Vercel cron error on Hobby
Cause:
- Non-daily cron schedule is not allowed on Hobby
Fix:
- Keep daily cron in vercel.json
- Use external scheduler for more frequent calls

### 16.7 TypeScript build errors in API route
Fix:
- Run npm run check locally
- Confirm latest code includes booking action type fix

### 16.8 Vercel deployment failed: more than 12 Serverless Functions
Cause:
- Too many files inside the `api` folder (each file is treated as a function)
Fix:
- Keep helper modules outside `api`
- Consolidate related endpoints into shared dynamic routes when possible
- Re-deploy after verifying `find api -type f | wc -l` is 12 or lower on Hobby
